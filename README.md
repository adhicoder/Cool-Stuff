# Cool-Stuff
A repository of my experiments to create fun programs

1.  Quine - A program that prints itself
2.  2048 - A program that plays the game 2048 till it dies
3.  Pencilator - A program that downloads all comics from Zen Pencils and compiles them into a PDF
4.  Libjan - A program that asks for the name of a book and downloads the PDF from Libgen.io
